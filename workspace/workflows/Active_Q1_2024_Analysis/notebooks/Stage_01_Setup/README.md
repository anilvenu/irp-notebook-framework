# Stage 01: Setup

This stage handles initial setup and validation for the workflow.

## Steps

### Step 01: Initialize
- Validates database connectivity
- Sets up working directories
- Initializes logging
- **Idempotent**: Yes (can be run multiple times)

### Step 02: Validate
- Checks for required configuration files
- Validates file formats
- Verifies database tables
- **Idempotent**: No (should only run once per cycle)

## Prerequisites

Before running this stage:
1. Ensure database is initialized
2. Active cycle must exist
3. Template structure is in place

## Outputs

After successful completion:
- Working directories created
- Logging initialized
- Configuration validated
- Ready for Stage 02

## Common Issues

**Database connection fails:**
- Check SQL Server container is running
- Verify credentials in environment

**Validation warnings:**
- Add Excel files to `files/excel_configuration/`
- These are warnings only, not failures

## Next Stage

Once both steps complete successfully, proceed to Stage_02.
